# Portfolio-v1

This is a first attempt at making a portfolio using pure html and css for potential employers to take a look at my work and see a sample of my skills. On this website you will find links to my Github, LinkedIn , and a simple placeholder for my email for now. Aswell as 3 projects I have completed.
